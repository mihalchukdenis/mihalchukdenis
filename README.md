## Hi there 👋
Hi everyone, my name is **Denis**, my validator moniker is **SilverSurfer**. As you might have already guessed, my passion is surfing 🏄‍♂️ and protecting various networks from unwanted blocks 💪! These activities follow me through my whole life, and of course during this time I managed to gain experience not only in surfing, but also in validating nodes).

## Experience
There are literally endless hours to talk about my experience, so I'll just suggest you take a look at these addresses, which will probably say even more about me than I will myself!
