Hi everyone, my name is **Denis**, my validator moniker is **SilverSurfer**. As you might have already guessed, my passion is surfing üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and protecting various networks from unwanted blocks üí™! These activities follow me through my whole life, and of course during this time I managed to gain experience not only in surfing, but also in validating nodes).

There are literally endless hours to talk about my experience, so I'll just suggest you take a look at these addresses, which will probably say even more about me than I will myself!

Yes, yes, don't be surprised, I also sometimes write guides on the projects I like the most. If you have used my guide and want to give your fitback, then write to me in discord or tweet me, I'll be glad to chat with you!
